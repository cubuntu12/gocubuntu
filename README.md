## Ubuntu + Cinnamon = CUbuntu 

CUbuntu is a modern, sleek Material themed OS based on Linux Mint and comes with some tweaks. NOTE: CUbuntu is currently in alpha stage and 0.1-ALPHA iso (based on Linux Mint 19,  or Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) is the latest avaliable and you can get official support from Canonical up to 2023, however we'll provide lifelong support; for free!
